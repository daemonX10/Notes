# Model Evaluation Interview Questions - General Questions

## Question 1

**Define precision, recall, and F1-score.**

**Answer:**

### Definitions
- **Precision** = TP / (TP + FP)
- **Recall** = TP / (TP + FN)
- **F1-score** = 2 × (P × R) / (P + R)

### Interview Tip
Choose based on cost: FP cost → precision; FN cost → recall.

## Question 2

**What do you understand by the term “Confusion Matrix”?**

**Answer:**

### Structure
- True Positives (TP), False Positives (FP)
- False Negatives (FN), True Negatives (TN)

### Derived Metrics
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Specificity

### Interview Tip
Can derive all classification metrics from confusion matrix.

## Question 3

**Why is accuracy not always the best metric for model evaluation?**

**Answer:**

### Problem with Accuracy
- Misleading for imbalanced datasets
- A model predicting all majority class gets high accuracy

### Better Alternatives
F1, AUC, precision-recall curves

### Interview Tip
Always check class distribution before using accuracy.
