**PROMPT:**

```
- make todo of task and divide the text in chunk and for each chunk iterate the list of todo one by one and complete the task in small small part - save this in memory this thing permanently - 

1. formate this properly 
2. remove duplicate questions and unnecessary things 
3. make codes like that by reading and learning that should i able to write that logic in my interview 
4. make as segregation on topics  
5. make a short notes for revision 
6. for algorithm code make a visualization of flow of information what pass what not 
7. give interview speaking tips how to answer the question and present this question as i don't have industry experience

- for this [TOPIC_NAME] - keep it short, i want for revision

no i don't want like this i want you do for entire chunk not by one by one question 
```
